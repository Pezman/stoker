* figure out how to communicate with and kill a spawned rails process
* find a good chart library
* finish web interface :)
* resolve gem dependencies (hpricot, rails 2.1, sqlite3-ruby, will_paginate, scruffy?)
* maybe make a shoes app to make it as easy as possible to install stoker gem and then start/stop web interface
